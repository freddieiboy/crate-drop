# Crate Drop - Planning Document

## Core Concept
A location-based content discovery app. Users drop "crates" containing content (music, podcasts, stories, art) at real-world locations. Other users discover and open these crates by visiting those locations.

**The insight:** Content + Location = More meaningful, authentic experiences

**Focus:** Consumer-first. The joy is in *finding* and *opening*.

**Aesthetic:** 3D, tactile, collectible

---

## Content Philosophy

### The Core Belief
**Human-created content only.** No AI-generated filler. The magic is *human intent* meeting *real place*. A person chose this spot. A person made this thing. That's the soul of the app.

### What Makes Content "Worth the Walk"

Content earns the journey when it does one of these:

| Content Type | What It Does | Example |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Made FOR the place** | Created with that location in mind | A song written on that bench, a story set at that corner |
| **Reveals the place** | Shows something hidden or unknown | "Most people don't know this building used to be..." |
| **Creates a moment AT the place** | Prompts action, not just consumption | "Stop. Look up. What do you see?" |
| **Personal connection** | Someone's real memory or meaning | "I proposed here. This is the song that was playing." |

### The Journey IS Content

The walk, the anticipation, the arriving - these are part of the experience. The crate doesn't carry all the weight. A 30-second voice note can be profound if the journey to get there built anticipation.

```
Walk (anticipation) → Arrive (discovery) → Open (payoff)
        ↑                                       ↓
   This matters                           So does this
```

### Quest Content Structure

For multi-crate quests, each crate should build tension:

| Crate | Role | Example Content |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **1 (close)** | Hook | A question, a mystery, a beginning |
| **2 (further)** | Build | A clue, deeper context, rising action |
| **3 (furthest)** | Payoff | The answer, the reveal, the reward |

Quest types that work:

- **Mystery** - riddle → clue → answer
- **Memory journey** - "think of someone" → "remember a moment" → "here's what to do with that"
- **Local guide** - "I love this spot" → "now notice this" → "my favorite place"
- **Sound journey** - ambient → building → full song
- **Reflection** - look around → look back → look forward

### Who Creates the Content?

The cold start / human content problem:

| Source | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **You (founder)** | Seed the first quests, prove the magic |
| **Local creators** | Writers, musicians, podcasters with location ties |
| **Campus ambassadors** | Students building quests for their schools |
| **Local businesses** | Coffee shop quest that ends at their door |
| **Memory holders** | Older residents sharing "what this used to be" |
| **Travelers** | Dropping content in places they visited |

### Creator Incentives

Why would someone spend time making a quest?

- **Visibility** - people find your work by exploring
- **Legacy** - your content lives in a place, maybe forever
- **Crate coins** - earn currency for creating
- **Reputation** - build a following as a creator
- **Unlocks** - access to rare crate types

### Content Guidelines

To maintain quality and authenticity:

- **Short is fine** - 30 seconds of voice, 2 paragraphs of text
- **Location must matter** - if it could be anywhere, it shouldn't be here
- **No spam** - one meaningful crate > ten throwaway ones
- **Personal > polished** - a raw voice note beats corporate content

### The Prototype Test

The first quest should be simple:

**3 crates. 3 spots that mean something. Each contains:**
- A short voice note or text (30 sec to read/hear)
- Why this place matters to the creator
- A prompt or question for the finder

**The test:** Will someone walk to 3 locations for a stranger's personal story about place?

If yes → concept works.
If no → adjust content type, length, or incentive.

---

## Reach vs Place vs Circle

### The Tension
The core pitch is "location = meaning." But creators need **reach**. Social media works because one post can reach millions instantly. A crate at a specific corner might get seen by... dozens?

For artists, musicians, podcasters - reach is survival. How do we give them millions of eyes without abandoning the location-based soul of the app?

### The Three Modes

| Mode | Anchor | Who Sees It | Best For |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **HERE** | This specific spot | Anyone who comes to this place | Tour guides, local businesses, place-specific stories |
| **EVERYWHERE** | Wherever crowds are | Anyone, maximum reach | Artists seeking exposure, busker energy |
| **MY PEOPLE** | Wherever your circle is | Only friends/group members | Private shares, fan clubs, intimate moments |

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Where should this crate live?                      │
│                                                     │
│  ○ HERE - This spot. Anyone who visits.            │
│                                                     │
│  ○ EVERYWHERE - Find crowds. Maximum reach.        │
│                                                     │
│  ○ MY PEOPLE - Only my circle, wherever they are.  │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Place. People. Circle.**

---

### Why Would Anyone Choose HERE?

If EVERYWHERE gives max reach, why not always pick it?

**The tradeoff: breadth vs depth.**

| | EVERYWHERE | HERE |
|---|-----------|------|
| **Reach** | High | Low |
| **Competition** | Crowded, noisy | You own the spot |
| **Intent** | Passive (scrolling by) | Active (made the journey) |
| **Engagement** | Shallow | Deep |
| **Identity** | Lost in the feed | "The creator of this place" |

**10,000 passive opens vs 100 pilgrimages** - which matters more?

For some creators, 100 people who walked 20 minutes to find their song is more meaningful than 10,000 who swiped past it at a train station.

### Who Uses Each Mode

**HERE - Place-bound**
- Tour guides creating city experiences
- Local businesses driving foot traffic
- Influencers owning their city's identity
- Artists with site-specific work
- Memory keepers ("this is where I proposed")

**EVERYWHERE - People-bound**
- Musicians seeking discovery
- Podcasters building audience
- Promoters, marketers
- Anyone prioritizing reach over meaning

**MY PEOPLE - Circle-bound**
- Friend groups sharing privately
- Bands with fan clubs (exclusive drops)
- Family memories
- Private quests for your crew
- Group challenges

---

### How EVERYWHERE Works

People-bound crates follow human patterns, not geography:

- **Rush hour** → appears at train stations, bus stops
- **Lunch time** → surfaces in business districts, food courts
- **Friday night** → shows up in bar/club zones
- **Weekend morning** → parks, coffee shops, farmer's markets
- **Events** → concerts, games, festivals

The crate rides the wave of human activity. Same content, millions of touchpoints.

**Reach mechanics:**
- **Replication** - same crate appears in multiple high-traffic spots
- **Viral floating** - popular crates spread to more locations
- **Density targeting** - appears wherever N+ people are gathered
- **Time surfacing** - active during peak hours, rests during quiet times

---

### How MY PEOPLE Works

Circle-bound crates follow your people, not places or crowds:

- Crate appears **on their commute** automatically
- Shows up near their home, work, daily routine
- Only visible to designated circle (friends, group, fan club)
- Programmatically placed for convenience - slower than a text, but more magical

**The vibe:** Like a messenger, but you have to find it. Adds ceremony to sharing.

---

### Preserving Meaning Across Modes

Each mode has its own kind of meaning:

| Mode | The Meaning |
|------|-------------|
| **HERE** | "This place matters. I was here." |
| **EVERYWHERE** | "This moment in the flow of humanity. Serendipity." |
| **MY PEOPLE** | "This was for you. I thought of you." |

---

### Cold Start Bonus

The three modes solve cold start together:
- **EVERYWHERE** crates ensure no area feels empty
- **MY PEOPLE** crates follow users, guaranteed content
- **HERE** crates build over time as local creators emerge

---

## The Creator Funnel

### The Key Insight
The three modes aren't separate choices - they're a **funnel**.

```
EVERYWHERE (billboard) → HERE (the journey) → MY PEOPLE (the reward)
      ↓                        ↓                      ↓
   Awareness              Prove fandom           Inner circle
```

Artists use ALL THREE together:

### Example: The Mixtape Drop

**Step 1: EVERYWHERE (Awareness)**
- Artist drops a single everywhere - it's a teaser, a billboard
- Millions see it floating through train stations, lunch crowds
- The crate says: *"This is just the intro. The real mixtape is hidden across the city."*

**Step 2: HERE (The Journey)**
- The full mixtape is scattered across 10 meaningful locations
- Each spot was chosen for a reason - where the song was written, places that inspired the lyrics
- Fans must travel to all 10 to collect the complete work

**Step 3: Completion → MY PEOPLE (The Reward)**
- When a fan collects all 10, they **automatically join the artist's inner circle**
- They become a "Top Fan" - verified by effort, not just clicks
- The artist can now send MY PEOPLE crates directly to them

**Step 4: MY PEOPLE (Ongoing)**
- Exclusive early releases
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Direct communication
- The artist now has a **qualified, devoted audience**

### Why This Works

| Stage | What It Does | Value |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **EVERYWHERE** | Casts wide net | Awareness, discovery |
| **HERE** | Filters for real fans | Effort = proof of devotion |
| **MY PEOPLE** | Rewards the devoted | Intimacy, loyalty, direct access |

**The fans who walked to all 10 spots aren't casual listeners. They're devotees.**

### Earned Intimacy

This flips the creator-fan relationship:
- Traditional social: anyone can follow, low signal
- Crate Drop: you EARN access to the inner circle

The journey is the filter. The reward is the relationship.

### Other Funnel Examples

**Author launching a book:**
1. EVERYWHERE: First chapter as teaser
2. HERE: Hidden chapters across the city, building the story
3. MY PEOPLE: Readers who finish get early access to next book

**Podcast host:**
1. EVERYWHERE: Best-of clips floating through commuter crowds
2. HERE: Full episodes dropped at locations mentioned in the show
3. MY PEOPLE: Listeners who complete the journey get bonus episodes

**Local business:**
1. EVERYWHERE: Discount code crate in nearby crowds
2. HERE: Scavenger hunt leading to the store
3. MY PEOPLE: Customers who complete become VIPs

## Visual Language

### Cratetrinos (Crate Shapes)
Crates are 3D objects built on an **80x80 grid unit**. Shapes vary like Tetris pieces:

```
▢       ▢▢      ▢        ▢▢▢      ▢
        ▢▢      ▢▢         ▢      ▢
                ▢                  ▢
                                   ▢
[1x1]   [2x2]   [L]      [T]      [I]
```

### Shape = Difficulty & Content

| Shape | Difficulty | Content | Notes |
|-------|------------|---------|-------|
| **1x1** | Easiest | Quick content | Simple tap, low barrier |
| **2x2** | Harder | More content, rarer | Takes inventory space, harder unlock |
| **L/T** | Medium | Multi-part? | Could indicate quest structure |
| **I (long)** | Social | Needs multiple people | Length = number of tappers needed |

Shape communicates what you're getting into before you open it.

### Skins
- **Default crates** - standard materials (wood, metal, etc.)
- **Geo-fenced skins** - location-specific looks
  - NYC subway tile crate
  - Tokyo neon crate
  - Beach driftwood crate
  - College campus crate with school colors
- Skins add local flavor, make locations feel unique

### The Opening Moment
Inspired by:
- **Pokemon evolution** - dramatic, building anticipation, transformation
- **Overwatch loot boxes** - suspense, reveal, reward feedback

The open sequence should feel like an *event*:
1. Crate lifts/hovers
2. Glows, shakes, particles
3. Cracks/splits open
4. Content emerges dramatically
5. Sound design carries the moment

**Rewards on open:**
- The content itself
- Crate coins (currency)
- Possibly: unlock that crate type for dropping

---

## Inventory System

**Inspired by:** Resident Evil

### Core Mechanics
- **Limited space** - grid-based, must fit cratetrinos
- **Upgradable** - earn more space over time
- **Always a cap** - never infinite, always choices
- **Tetris puzzle** - fitting shapes is part of the game

### The Balance
```
Find crates → Open crates → Make room → Find more
     ↓              ↓
  Fills up     Rewards + space freed
```

Regular rhythm of discovery → opening → discovery.

### When Inventory is Full: The Depot

Can't carry more? **Send crates to the Depot.**

- Crates go to a holding area
- They get **delivered to your location** later (like Amazon)
- Maybe arrives next day, or later in the week
- Creates anticipation, delayed gratification
- Your "doorstep" = your home location or current spot

---

## Content Ordering (Cold Start Solution!)

**Browse & Order from Other Cities**

- Preview crates from around the world
- See what's popular in Tokyo, NYC, Berlin
- **Order it** → arrives at your doorstep next morning
- Like content delivery / e-commerce for experiences

This solves cold start elegantly:
- New user in empty area? Order from anywhere.
- Familiar UX (everyone knows delivery)
- Adds global discovery layer
- Creates "what's hot in [city]" browsing

---

## Crate Coins (Currency)

Earned by:
- Opening crates
- Completing quests
- Other achievements?

Spent on:
- Unlocking crate types to drop
- Inventory upgrades
- **Virtual Arcade** (!)
- Ordering content from other cities?
- Cosmetics / skins?

### Virtual Arcade
A meta space where crate coins have utility beyond core loop.
- Mini-games?
- Social space?
- Rare unlocks?
- TBD - but adds depth to economy

---

## Creator Progression

**Everyone can drop crates.**

| Level | What You Can Drop |
|-------|-------------------|
| **New user** | Basic crate types (1x1 message, image, voice) |
| **Explorer** | Unlocks more types by finding them in the wild |
| **Veteran** | Access to rare/special crate types, larger shapes |

**The loop:**
```
Find rare crate → Open it → Unlock ability to drop that type
         ↓
Now YOU can create that experience for others
```

---

## Core UX Flow

```
User walking to class
    ↓
Opens app, checks RADAR
    ↓
Sees 3 crates within a few blocks
    ↓
Identifies types by shape/skin: Quest (L-shape), Music (1x1), App (2x2)
    ↓
Walks to locations, collects crates
    ↓
Inventory getting full - sends one to Depot
    ↓
In class, friend sends a direct crate
    ↓
Opens it based on its unlock method
    ↓
Earns crate coins, unlocks new drop type
    ↓
Evening: Depot delivery arrives at home
    ↓
Opens delivered crate, maybe orders one from Tokyo
```

## Crate Types

### Content Crates
| Type | What's Inside | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Music** | Song, album, playlist | Artist drops track at the studio where they recorded it |
| **Story** | Text, narration | Writer drops chapter at a park bench |
| **Voice** | Audio message | Friend leaves you a note at your favorite spot |
| **Image** | Photo, art | Photographer drops shots at the location they were taken |
| **Video** | Clip, short film | Filmmaker drops scene at filming location |

### Quest Crates

- One crate leads to the next
- Could be a story, a scavenger hunt, a journey
- Final crate requires completing the chain
- Maybe requires collecting "pieces" to unlock the finale

### App Crates
- Micro-apps locked to a location
- **Dating crate** - only works at that coffee shop
- **Confession crate** - anonymous thoughts at a park
- **Voting crate** - polls that exist in one place
- **Game crate** - multiplayer game only at that spot
- This is a platform within a platform

### Direct Crates
- Sent person-to-person
- Not tied to public discovery
- Gift, message, surprise

## Unlock Mechanics

*How you open a crate is part of its meaning.*

| Unlock Type | How It Works | Vibe |
|-------------|--------------|------|
| **Tap** | Just tap to open | Easy, casual |
| **Passcode** | Enter a code to open | Private, exclusive |
| **Location** | Must be at the spot | "You had to be there" |
| **Duo** | 2 people together to open | Shared moment |
| **Crowd** | Group of people required | Event, gathering |
| **Sing** | Sing/hum to unlock | Playful, vulnerable |
| **Time** | Only opens at certain times | Anticipation |
| **Shake** | Physical gesture | Tactile |
| **Chain** | Must open previous crates first | Earned access |

More ideas:
- **Whisper** - speak softly
- **Wait** - sit with it for 60 seconds
- **Weather** - only opens when it's raining
- **Heartbeat** - calm your heart rate (health kit)

---

## Radar (Home Screen)

The radar shows:
- Cratetrinos nearby (3D shapes showing type)
- Distance/direction
- Skins visible (geo-fenced looks)
- Maybe a hint of what's inside (muffled audio, blurred preview)
- Bookmarked crates you're tracking

Visual options:
- 3D map with crates floating at locations
- Abstract radar with pings and shapes
- AR overlay on camera feed

---
